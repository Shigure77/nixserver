# AGENTS.md

## Always-on rules (highest priority)

- **Modular first.** No code file over 300 LOC. Docs/plans may be any length;
  code must be split into small modules. Never limit scope to fit the LOC cap —
  split instead.
- **Think ahead.** Keep entrypoints stable; isolate logic into small modules
  from the start. Don't write code you already know you'll rewrite.
- **Fail fast.** No fallback code that hides breakage. No empty try/catch.
- **Don't reinvent the wheel.** Prefer open-source, self-hosted libraries; help
  the user qualify their choice before adding a dependency.

## Detailed rules (read the relevant file before acting)

- Project goal & context (read first) → `.agents/rules/project-goal.md`
- Comments & documentation placement → `.agents/rules/comments.md`
- Secrets & sensitive data → `.agents/rules/secrets.md`
- Autonomy & safety (read-only default, dry-run writes) → `.agents/rules/autonomy-and-safety.md`
- Research tools (docs lookup, web search) → `.agents/rules/research-tools.md`
- Continuity file workflow → `.agents/rules/continuity.md`
- Definition of done → `.agents/rules/definition-of-done.md`
- Version control (commits, branches, no force-push) → `.agents/rules/version-control.md`
- Handling ambiguity (ask vs. proceed) → `.agents/rules/ambiguity.md`
- Repository layout (keep `.agents/REPO_LAYOUT.md` current) → `.agents/rules/repo-layout.md`
- Repo layout map → `.agents/REPO_LAYOUT.md`

### Per-language rules (read the one matching the file you're editing)

- Template for adding a language → `.agents/rules/lang/_TEMPLATE.md`
- Python code → `.agents/rules/lang/python.md`
- Nix code (Dendritic Pattern) → `.agents/rules/lang/nix.md`
- `<add more, e.g. TypeScript → .agents/rules/lang/typescript.md>`

## Continuity (quick reminder — full rules in the file above)

Maintain `.agents/CONTINUITY.md`. **Read it at the start of every turn** before
acting; update it when goal/state/decisions materially change.
